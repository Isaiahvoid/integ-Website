    <h2>Debugging My Expectations</h2> <p>What if I told you that sometimes, no matter how
    much I study, it still feels like I’m falling behind? No matter how much I
    try, I struggle to understand the lessons because of my slow learning pace,
    while everyone else seems ahead of me. Even though it’s already my second
    year, there are days when I feel left behind while my classmates grasp
    concepts faster. It makes me wonder if I’ll really be ready for a career in
    CS someday. But even with all these doubts, I still believe I can improve,
    learn programming better, and slowly find my place in this field.</p>

    <h2>Learning at My Own Clock Speed</h2> 
      <h3>The Skills I’m Still Working On</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the hardest parts of CS for me is
        programming, especially when it comes to logical thinking and problem
        solving. There are still many times when I don’t understand a problem
        right away. While some of my classmates can write code quickly and solve
        tasks almost instantly, I often need more time just to figure out the
        logic. Sometimes it even takes me hours to fully understand a single
        problem. Because of that, I have moments where I feel frustrated and
        pressured, and I start questioning myself, wondering if I’m just a slow
        learner who can’t keep up.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time goes by, I’m realizing that struggling and making
        mistakes are normal parts of learning. Failure isn’t a reason for me to give up,
        it’s a reminder to keep pushing myself toward my goals and future. Instead of
        avoiding difficult problems like I used to, I’m trying to face them step by
        step, even if I don’t get the right answer on my first try. I’m learning that
        progress may be slow, but it’s still progress, and that’s what really matters.
        And as I think about what comes next, I can’t help but wonder how these lessons
        will shape the career I want to build and the skills I still need to master.</p>

      
    <h2>Compiling a Future Worth Having</h2> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back, I realize that my
    journey in CS is not just about becoming good at programming, but about
    learning how to be patient with myself. Struggling with lessons, taking
    longer to understand problems, and making mistakes used to make me feel
    discouraged, but now I see them as part of my growth. My biggest takeaway is
    that progress doesn’t have to be fast to be meaningful. I’m slowly learning
    to stop comparing myself to others and focus on improving little by little,
    at my own pace.</p>

        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the future, I still don’t know exactly where this
        course will lead me. If I end up working in the tech industry, I’ll be proud
        because I know how hard I worked to get there. But even if my path turns out
        differently, my goal is simple: to have a stable job, be financially stable, and
        build a life I can be proud of. One of my biggest dreams is to repay my parents
        for all the support, sacrifices, and encouragement they gave me throughout my
        journey as a CS student. They are the reason I’m able to study at a university,
        and I want to give back to them someday, not just financially, but by showing
        them that all their hard work was worth it. No matter where I end up, I want to
        carry the resilience, patience, and determination I’m learning now, because
        those are the things that will truly help me move forward.</p>
