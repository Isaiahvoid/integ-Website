        <p>What if I told you that riding my motorcycle with
        music on is the only time my mind feels alive and I feel truly connected to
        the moment? Whenever school gets overwhelming and life feels too heavy, I
        ride with my playlist playing and let the road take my stress away. Hindi
        lang siya basta ride para sa akin, it’s my escape from pressure,
        expectations, and overthinking. Sa bawat takbo ng motor at bawat kanta,
        pakiramdam ko mas gumagaan ang lahat.</p>

      <h2>How I Started Riding</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t start with a motorcycle right away. It all
        began when I learned how to ride a bike. At first, I only rode near our
        house, just going around the streets where I felt safe. Then one day, I
        found out that you could actually ride on the main road, and that
        changed everything for me. I went with my friends on our bikes, and I
        still remember our first long ride going to MOA. I was scared because it
        was my first time riding on the main road, with so many cars passing by
        while we stayed in the bike lane. But while I was focusing on the road
        and my surroundings, I suddenly felt alive and present in the moment.
        That ride made me realize how powerful it feels to be moving forward on
        your own, using your own strength. Back then, I didn’t even listen to
        music because we needed to communicate with each other to stay together
        as a group. When we finally arrived at MOA, I thought to myself, “So
        this is what it feels like to ride,” and from that moment, I knew riding
        would always be a part of me.

            </div>
        
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast forward to 2024, when my father bought me my
            first motorcycle. At first, I felt like a total newbie, even though
            knowing how to ride a bike made it a bit easier. My first ride to school
            on the national road was nerve-wracking, and I kept my speed at only
            30–50 kph. I remember thinking that riding in the city was boring and
            full of pollution. But after a few rides, I got used to it, and it
            started to feel normal because, well, this is Manila. I also noticed
            other motor riders on the road, some reckless and impatient, the kind
            people call “Kamote riders.” I told myself I would never be like them.
            When I started doing long rides outside the city, it felt completely
            different from city driving. The roads were clearer, with fewer
            vehicles, less pollution, and the views were beautiful, the sky so
            clear, and stretches of grass and trees on the side of the road while
            the fresh air hit me as I rode. I realized that every ride slowly became
            something more personal. Riding became my space to think, to breathe,
            and to feel free, especially when school and life started to feel heavy.
            Kahit simpleng biyahe lang, parang doon ko nahahanap yung sarili ko.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, I also realized that I became a little
            “kamote” too, but in a different way. For me, it’s just squeezing
            through traffic when needed, and maintaining my speed around 60 kph,
            sometimes a little faster when the road is clear. The difference is, I
            ride with caution, follow traffic rules, and respect other riders, not
            like some who ignore regulations and end up in accidents. Riding taught
            me that being a “kamote” doesn’t have to mean being careless, it can
            also mean being smart, aware, and responsible on the road.</p>

    <h2>Finding Balance on Two Wheels</h2>
    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <div class="inline-img-container">

        </div> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back, I realized that
        riding is not just about going from one place to another. It became my way
        of finding balance when school and life feel overwhelming. From learning how
        to ride a bike, to riding my first motorcycle, and discovering how music
        helps me stay focused on the road, every experience taught me something
        about myself. I learned that it’s okay to feel scared at first, to make
        mistakes, and to start slow, because that’s part of growing.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My takeaway is simple: you don’t have to be perfect to
        move forward, you just have to keep riding and take small steps to improve
        and grow through whatever you’re going through. Sa bawat biyahe, mas
        natututo akong maging patient, responsible, at mas confident sa sarili ko.
        Riding with music has become more than just a hobby—it’s my way to stay
        present, enjoy the moment, and feel alive even when school and life feel
        stressful. With every ride, it feels like I can escape my problems and
        pressures, even for a little while, while reflecting and breathing freely.
        <i>Each journey becomes a memory I carry with me, a small story of how I
        faced the road, the music, and myself, a moment where I feel free, alive,
        and completely in the present.</i></p>
